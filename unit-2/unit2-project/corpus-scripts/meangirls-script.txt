 FADE IN:
INT. CADY'S ROOM. EARLY MORNING.
There are boxes around the undecorated room. The clock says 6:29 am.
C.l\DY HERON, 15, lies in bed asleeo. She is naturally pretty. Her
long hair has never been dyed. Her eyebrows have never been nlucked.
She has a fantastic tan. -
The clock hits 6:30 and the alarm goes off. Cady opens her eyes.
CADY
(groggy)
Okay, I'm up.
Cady closes her eyes for what seems like a second. When she opens
them again, the clock says 7:15.
Cady screams and jumps out of bed.
INT. HALLWAY.- A FEW MINUTES LATER.
Cady rushes out. Now she's wearing khaki pants, a faded izod, and a
khaki bucket.hat. Her nom rushes bv her.
BETSY
You're gonna be late. Come here.
I'll braid your hair.
INT. CADY'S KITCHEN. A FEW MINUTES LATER.
The kitchen is full of boxes. Cady (hair french-braided) pours. two
bowls of cat food. Two cats come running. They hiss at each other.
CADY
Cleo, be nice! Pamela! Stop it!
While the cats are fighting, a big droopy dog strolls in behind them.
CHIP (O.S.)
Come out front, Cady. I wanna get a
photo.
Cady is still wrestling with the cats.
CADY
Stop fighting. There's enough for
~verybody. _
Cady puts the cats by their bowls, but the dog has· eaten all their
fooa.
CADY
Why don't you fight with him?
The dog's slobbering face.

Cady's father CHIP, 43, a lanky professorial type, takes a picture of
Cady and her mother BETSY, 43. (Betsy is attractive but not concerned
with style. The kind of woman who would still wear a fanny pack.)
CHIP
That's good. Stay close.
Betsy bursts into tears.
BETSY
My baby's going to school.
Cady comforts her mother.
CADY (V.O.)
I guess it's natural for parents to
cry on their kid's first day of
school. But this usually happens when
the kid is five.
Betsy has pulled Cady close and is hugging her.

CADY (V,O.)
I'm 15, and until today, I was home-
schooled. That means my mom was my
only teacher and my Dad was the only
sub. I know what you're thinking.
Home-schooled kids are freaks.

CADY (V.O.)
In my life so far, we'd lived in 9
countries on 3 continents. But it's

growing up. I'd spend all day in the
field with my parents.

My favorite subject was always math.
CHIP
You're done with this chapter already?
Okay, let's start on those, um,
inverse functions. Jeez.
C.Z;DY (V.O.)

Are you nervous? It's okay to be

Nervous. Nervous. Nervous. Nervous.

Cadv starts across the street. She is almost hit by a big yellow
school bus. She jumps back as her mother yelps.
BETSY
CADY
I'm okay. Sorry. I'll be careful.
Cady crosses the street. Hip hop blares from a car radio.
Cady passes the different groups outside the school. A group of
black students sitting on the grass.
CADY
Hi.
They just stare at her. Cady keeps walking.

Cady looks at her.
JANIS
Do you want to carry attendance sheets

Cady moves to a third chair.
JANIS
No.
Cady stops. Janis points to the guy in front of Cady:
JANIS
He farts a lot.
Cady looks at the guy. He looks like a guy who would fart a lot.

JANIS
Spring Fling is not important.
DAMIAN
It is to me. At the end of every
year, the graduating seniors throw a
aance called Spring Fling for the
underclassmen. Whomsoever is elected
Spring Fling King and Queen

it's pretty important to me.

Why do you hate them?
JANIS
What do you mean?
CADY
You seem to really hate t~em.
JANIS
Yes. What's your question?

The bell rings. The guy next to Cadv, BARRY, 17, a tall, skinny,
good-natured guy drops something as ne passes Cady. As Cady picks it
up, KEVIN GNOR, a completely American "Asian Math Nerd" comes up to
her.
KEVIN GNOR
E~y, iou're the Homeschool girl,

Yeah.
CADY
KEVIN GNOR
I'm captain of the Evanston Mathletes.
We participate in matl:" challenges
against otner high schools around the
state. And we can get twice as much
funding from the school if we have a
girl. You should think about joining.·
MS. NORBURY
You'd be perfect for it.
CADY
Yeah, definitely.
KEVIN GNOR
Great. Let me give you my number.
Kevin pulls out a pre-printed business card that reads "Kevin Gnor-
Math Enthusiast/Badass MC."
KEVIN GNOR
Think it over. Cause we'd like to get
jackets.
Cady hands the bag she found to Ms. Norbury.

Barry is licking the binding of his textbook.
BARRY
I didn't take it. I found it at a
club.
MS. NORBURY
Barry, I used to work the night shift
at a diner. I'm really good at
telling when people are high. If you
come to my class high again, I will
know.
Barry reaches out to touch Ms. Norbury.
BJ!-.RRY
Shhh... d~n't be scared.
MS. ~ORBURY
Barry, Ew. Stop touching my hair.
BARRY
Are you gonna turn me in to the dean?
MS. NORBURY
Barry. I don't want you to get kicked
out of school. I want you to
graduate.
CADY (V.O.)
Ms. Norbu:-( and Barry made a deal that
if he didn t come to school high
anymore, she wouldn't tell the dean.
Ms. Norbury leaves the stairwell. Cady watches unnoticed as Ms.
Norburt goes to throw the baggy in the trash, then realizing someone
will find it, she goes into her class, throws it in her desk drawer
and locks it.
CADY (V.O.)
But she did call Barry's parents.

Cady looks at a·bulletin board full of snapshots. They all feature
Regina. One is a large picture of Regina and Aaron as last year's
Spring Fling King and Queen.
Regina takes a swig of rum and passes the bottle to Karen who drinks

ecstasy in it.
MS. NORBURY
No, Joan. Those aren't mine•••
Joan brushes by her with cold efficiency and heads back into the

Ms. Norbury, fias already lost her job
over it.
Cady is shocked.
MR. DUVALL (CONT'D)
And Coach Farr has fled school
