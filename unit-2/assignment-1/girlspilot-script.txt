"THE UNTITLED LENA DUNHAM PROJECT" PILOT (TOGETHER)
Written by Lena Dunham 10/23/2010
  
INT. MIDTOWN RESTAURANT, EVENING
HANNAH-- 24, sweet-faced, slightly chubby-- sits across from her parents: TAD--early 60s, professorial-- and LOREEN, slim and understated, also in her 60s. Loreen and Tad slowly work on their food while Hannah eats speedily, back and forth between a bowl of pasta, a salad, a side of spinach and a baked potato.
LOREEN
Would you two slow down? You’re
eating like it’s going out of style.
HANNAH (mouth full)
I’m a growing girl.
A drip of sauce hits Tad’s shirt.
TAD Meant to do that.
Hannah laughs.
LOREEN
Your whole Brooklyn thing, Hannah.
It reminds me of Berkeley in the 1970s. My boyfriend at the time, Ned. He lived in a communal space a bit like yours.
HANNAH (laughing)
I have one roommate, mom.
LOREEN
But that boyfriend of hers seems
always to be around.
TAD
We’re sorry we never got to meet
this fellow you’re dating.
HANNAH
Dating is probably a polite word
for what we’re doing, but yeah.
LOREEN
Hannah, that’s your father. Spare
him the TMI. (pause)
That’s a thing, right? TMI? (MORE)

Pause
LOREEN (CONT'D)
One of my students said it and I
thought it was just so funny.
HANNAH (to Tad)
I’m sorry, papa. you?
TAD I’m rolling with
Did that upset it.
LOREEN
Tad. We should probably bring it up
now.
TAD
Let’s finish recapping the weekend
and then we can--
LOREEN
No, I don’t want to just leave it
til the end of dinner.
TAD (nodding)
OK, I hear that. (sensitive)
Hannah. Your mother and I have been talking and we feel it may be time--
LOREEN
You need to get a job.
TAD (to Loreen)
OK, I wasn’t going to phrase it like that. The way you phrased it-- complete ambush, Loreen. You have to approach these things like--
HANNAH (quietly)
But I have a job.
TAD (comforting)
We know you have a job.
LOREEN
You have an internship.
2.

HANNAH
An internship that will probably
turn into a job. That’s how it works. You intern and then it turns into a--
TAD
Hannah, it’s a unique time in
history. You remember Janice Miller? Her daughter has her MBA and she’s the personal assistant to an Israeli man who owns three Taco Bells.
LOREEN
Andrea Weisz supported her son for
five years while he attempted to launch an urban t-shirt business. And now he’s in jail.
HANNAH
You haven’t been supporting me for
five years. I just graduated and--
LOREEN
You didn’t just graduate.
Hannah is in disbelief at her mother’s cruelty.
LOREEN (CONT’D)
She didn’t! I’m sorry, but it’s
been almost two years.
TAD
I told my mother I was “just
trying” pot the first five times she caught me. But I guess at a certain point--
LOREEN
You were just a pot head.
TAD That’s the truth.
LOREEN
The bills add up. We’re covering
your rent, your insurance, your cell phone--
HANNAH (scandalized)
But you said it was cheaper for you if I was on the family plan!
3.

LOREEN
Tad, can you get involved here?
TAD (more patient)
If they’re not going to hire you at this publishing outfit then--
HANNAH
They’re not not going to hire me.
(pause)
They just haven’t hired me yet.
LOREEN
Well if you can’t find a job here,
you can always look in Ann Arbor. The university press needs a--
HANNAH (desperate)
What? I’m not moving home.
TAD
OK, calm down. No one’s
asking you to--
LOREEN
Ann Arbor is having a real
renaissance.
HANNAH (CONT’D)
A paint-your-own-pottery place is
not a renaissance! This is where my life is. My friends-- my book is set here!
LOREEN What book?
HANNAH
My book. I’m almost done with my
book. I mean, I basically have a draft, I’m just, like, getting the whole thing together...
TAD
We can talk more about this
tomorrow.
HANNAH
I don’t have time to see you
tomorrow!
LOREEN
What? But we fly out Tuesday
morning.
4.

HANNAH
I have work, OK? And then a dinner
thing. I’m busy. Trying to become who I am.
OPENING CREDITS
INT. HANNAH’S BEDROOM, MORNING
A tiny Brooklyn bedroom. Pale pink, with a few carefully curated posters: Whit Stillman’s “Metropolitan”, Bette Midler’s “Thighs and Whispers.” A funny photo of Philip Roth. Jerry Seinfeld & co. in bondage gear on an old Rolling Stone.
Two pairs of naked tangled legs. Post-coital? Pan up to reveal a decidedly nonsexual embrace between HANNAH and MARNIE, 23, pretty like Audrey Hepburn circa middle-school, black glasses askew. Hannah wears a huge plaid sleep sack. Nearby: an empty sack of corn nuts and a laptop looping the Mary Tyler Moore DVD menu.
An iphone alarm goes off. Marnie slaps at Hannah.
MARNIE Alarm.
Hannah feels around. It’s somewhere in the folds of her covers. Sits up. The noise is becoming intolerable.
HANNAH Stand up.
Marnie rises sleepily. Hannah stands.
MARNIE What? Where?
Hannah rips the covers off the bed and the iphone bounces onto the floor. Hannah grabs it, still honking, holds it up like a trophy.
EXT. NOLITA STREET, DAY
A cab pulls to a stop. JESSA, 24, beautiful but strung out, wearing a bowler hat, dead sleep against a pile of suitcases.
CAB DRIVER
You here. (nothing)
Miss, you here. Jessa snaps to.
5.

JESSA Already?
She emerges from the cab, pulling her suitcase with her, and starts to walk.
CAB DRIVER Miss, you have to pay!
She genuinely forgot.
JESSA Oh, I’m so sorry.
CAB DRIVER
It’s forty five from the airport.
Dazed, she fishes around in her purse, pulling out crumpled bills and stuffing them into the driver’s hands. She’s already made strides before he shouts:
CAB DRIVER (CONT’D) This is not American money!
INT. HANNAH AND MARNIE’S LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN, MORNING
Another tiny space but they’ve done what they can-- vintage furniture, a pool blue wall, assorted tchochkes (piggie-bank that says “Mad Money”, wall plaque that reads “Shalom Y’all.”) CHARLIE-- 25, skinny hipster oozing kindness-- makes coffee. The girls emerge from Hannah’s room.
CHARLIE Good morning.
MARNIE
(muffled by mouth guard)
You should have woken me up. I didn’t mean to sleep with Hannah.
CHARLIE (shrugging)
You two looked so angelic.
HANNAH (groaning)
My dad says waking up gets a lot easier after you turn twenty five.
CHARLIE
Your dad... is a liar. Coffee?
6.

HANNAH Coffee’s for grownups.
Hannah grabs something from the fridge and skitters into the bathroom. Marnie removes her mouth guard, holds it in the palm of her hand.
CHARLIE A present? For me?
MARNIE
I’m sorry you had to sleep alone.
CHARLIE Barely noticed.
He removes her glasses, kisses her on the cheek.
INT. BATHROOM, MORNING
HANNAH sits in the corner of the shower/tub, letting the water hit her lower half while she hangs her upper body over
the edge so she can simultaneously enters in a towel.
MARNIE
Need to shave mah’ legs.
She sits on the edge of the tub, a
eat a cupcake. MARNIE
leg on Hannah for support.
HANNAH
You’re going to leave your towel
on? You always see me naked and I never see you naked. It’s not fair.
Marnie shrugs.
HANNAH (CONT’D)
Why don’t I ever see your boobs? Do
you not like to have your friends see your boobs? Is that true?
MARNIE
Not really true, no. I don’t really
like to be touched by people I’m not having sex with. That’s true.
HANNAH (creepy voice)
You’ll never guess what I did to you in the night.
7.

Marnie shudders. Charlie opens the door, sees Hannah, closes it half-way.
CHARLIE
Whoa, sorry. Thought it was just my
girlfriend in here.
HANNAH
Never just your girlfriend in here.
CHARLIE
Just saying goodbye. I’ll see you
ladies tonight. I’ll pick up wine!
He shuts the door. Hannah his finished eating and sticks her head under the water, shakes it like a dog.
INT. NOLITA APARTMENT BUILDING, DAY JESSA in in the ground floor hallway.
SHOSHANNA (O.S.)
Right here! 1A, as in big apple!
Jessa drags her things down the hall, reaches the door where her cousin SHOSHANNA--27, a JAP in velour sweats-- waits.
SHOSHANNA (CONT’D) Bonjour, roomie.
The two girls hugs, Shoshanna with more enthusiasm.
SHOSHANNA (CONT’D)
You look so hip I wanna’ puke. As
usual. I can never pull off a hat. How do you pull off that hat?
Pause
SHOSHANNA
Body like a rockstar. It’s too
much. Do you work out? You must work out.
(squeezing her)
You’re my favorite cousin, do you know that? You know that.
JESSA
Do you have anything I could eat?
I--
JESSA
8.

INT. HANNAH AND MARNIE’S LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN, MORNING
Dressed for work, the girls stand side by side at the fridge. Marnie grabs a yogurt, looks for a spoon.
HANNAH
Is that half a yogurt?
Marnie nods.
HANNAH (CONT’D)
That means you ate half a yogurt
and put the rest back. Marnie nods again.
HANNAH (CONT’D) That is so alien to me.
MARNIE
My stomach’s been really sensitive
lately. My mom says stomach aches are a stress plague on women in their early twenties.
HANNAH
OK, well... Here’s a glimpse into
my psychology--
She pulls another cupcake from the refrigerator.
HANNAH (CONT’D)
I’m going to eat this so it’s not there anymore. It’s like a dragon
that needs vanquishing.
She takes a bite. Icing plops onto her blouse.
HANNAH (CONT’D) Meant to do that.
EXT. BROOKLYN STREET, DAY
MARNIE and HANNAH walk toward the subway.
HANNAH
I’m just going to say it. Like,
I’ve been working here for a year and if I can’t get paid then I’ll have to move on. It costs a lot of money to look this cheap.
(pause)
You think it’ll work?
9.

MARNIE
It better. Otherwise I’m fresh
outta’ roommate.
HANNAH
Oh I’m sure Charlie is just waiting
to swoop in. He and I... (laughing)
We’re engaged in a silent, horns- locked battle for your love.
MARNIE (elbowing Hannah)
No contest... What’s the head count for tonight?
HANNAH
Just you, me, Charlie, Jessa. I
invited Adam, but...
MARNIE
When’s the last time you talked?
HANNAH
Like... five days ago? When he gave
me the book.
MARNIE
That was a really lovely gesture.
(pause)
Had he cum on your face that morning or just the night before?
HANNAH (ignoring her)
The poems are beautiful. Robert Lowell for the win. I texted him thank you but I haven’t heard back.
MARNIE
Left word, as we assistants say.
HANNAH
Maybe I should call him? I mean,
didn’t you say texting is the lowest form of communication? On the pillar of chat?
MARNIE
The totem of chat. The lowest
form... that would be facebook. Followed by g-chat. Then texting, then email, then phone. Face to face is, of course, ideal.
10.

HANNAH
But how do I get him face to face
if he won’t text me? (pause)
That’s the kind of thing you overhear terrible girls saying at brunch.
MARNIE Fuck brunch.
(pause)
So I’m going to make pasta and that bougey salad with the strawberries and feta.
HANNAH
I think Jessa will really
appreciate this. It’s a very friendish thing of us to do.
(pause)
I can’t believe she’s coming back.
MARNIE
She’s not coming back. She’s never
lived here. And I just know she’ll show up late in, like, some fabulous blanket-y dress from a Grecian marketplace. It’s all so predictable.
HANNAH (dreamy)
I have such fond memories of freshman orientation. The three of us on our bikes, being bitches to hippies... It’s the only time I’ve ever worn shorts and felt OK about it.
(pause)
We have something to learn from Jessa, you know? She’s sweet. she isn’t all...
Hannah makes two puppets with her hands that
HANNAH (CONT’D)
Life isn’t a cleverness contest for
her.
MARNIE
Life isn’t a cleverness contest for
us!
won’t shut up.
11.

HANNAH
Remember what Carolyn used to call
her? The no-drama mama.
MARNIE
She did call her that, yeah. Before
Jessa had sex with Carolyn’s boyfriend.
HANNAH
That guy was so slimy and
manipulative. And then the buzzards descended on Jessa’s prone carcass. That’s why she left school.
MARNIE
She left school because she
couldn’t get her Adderall prescription refilled.
(softening)
I love Jessa, OK? But I don’t know if she’s playing for the girl’s team. And that’s a big deal.
HANNAH
What’s the girls team? Am I playing
for it?
MARNIE
You’re the captain of it. You’re
the chairman of the league. I wouldn’t trust Jessa alone with my boyfriend.
HANNAH
But you’d trust me alone with your
boyfriend? After the way he looked at me in the shower this morning? Wolf eyes! A-woo-ga!
INT. SHOSHANNA’S NOLITA APARTMENT, DAY
A tiny studio with a queen-sized bed on one side and a single on the other, a Sex and the City poster hanging above it. The lone window faces a brick wall. JESSA scarfs Triscuits like she hasn’t eaten in years.
SHOSHANNA
It’s a great deal for NoLiTa. I
mean, 2,100 a month? Amazing. (pause)
Do you like the poster?
12.

She is.
JESSA
I’ve never seen that movie.
SHOSHANNA Only the show?
JESSA It’s a show too?
SHOSHANNA
Oh. My. God. You can’t be serious.
SHOSHANNA (CONT’D)
Agh! This is so fun! That means I
get to start all over again. I’m being revirginized!
(pause)
You’re a funny one, because you’re probably a Carrie but with Samantha aspects. And Charlotte hair.
INT. BLUM AND CHISHOLM OFFICE, DAY
MARNIE, headset on, sits at a desk in a sleek, corporate office. Her boss, REESE-- early 40s botox blonde-- is inside a glass office.
MARNIE
Blum and Chisholm Public Relations.
Reese Kwartler’s office. (pause)
This is her assistant Marnie. Will you hold just a moment?
Marnie dials Reese, who picks up.
REESE What’s up?
MARNIE
It’s the Traverse Daily Herald.
They’re looking for a quote on the Hasbrook Motors Spill... That killed the pack of doves.
REESE Flock of doves.
MARNIE
The story is going online this
afternoon. (MORE)
13.

MARNIE (CONT'D)
Local news, but it’ll most likely
be linked from HuffPo, the Daily Beast.
REESE
I’m swamped in here. Just
neutralize as best you can.
Reese is creating a J-Date profile, moving the mouse between “slim” and “athletic” as her body type descriptor. Terrified, Marnie picks up the waiting call.
MARNIE
I’m sorry about that. Reese is
indisposed at the moment, but... In regards to the spill... We can safely say that if the public knew the truth, they wouldn’t be quite so quick to condemn Hasbrook Motors.
(pause)
Why? Why? Well, sir, because doves...
(pause)
Doves kill babies.
(what has she done?) Yes, sir. Their own babies.
INT. ROSEBLOOD PRESS OFFICE, DAY
HANNAH is in an open-plan Brooklyn office, among tattooed hipsters and girls with bangs, talking on her iphone. She has a pile of manuscripts on her desk, glancing at the first page then dropping them to the floor with a thud.
HANNAH
Doves kill babies? You told them
doves kill babies?
INT. BLUM AND CHISHOLM OFFICE, DAY, INTERCUT
MARNIE (horrified)
I said doves often kill their own young. Which is true.
HANNAH
I once held a baby sparrow from a
nest on my porch, then put it back. And the next day its mom ate it.
GIRL WITH BANGS looks up from copy-editing, addresses Hannah.
14.

GIRL WITH BANGS Oh my God, that’s awful.
See?
MARNIE
HANNAH You’re evil.
MARNIE (palpably afraid)
And fired. I’m probably fired. (pause)
Did you ask yet? About the money?
HANNAH
I’m going through the slush pile
right now. This gives me such pleasure, rejecting submissions.
(looking at a manuscript)
Why would someone write a memoir of the months they spent living in Portland in 2003?
MARNIE Hannah, motivate.
Reese comes to the door.
REESE Marnie, can I see
MARNIE (to Hannah)
INT. ROSEBLOOD PRESS OFFICE, DAY
HANNAH approaches ALISTAIR-- an Irishman in his early forties.
HANNAH Hey, Alistair.
ALISTAIR G’day, Hannah.
HANNAH
So I finished reading that graphic
novel about transgendering... (MORE)
you a moment?
you on that. Marnie hangs up, turns to Reese, terrified.
We’ll get back to Thanks so much.
15.

HANNAH (CONT'D)
There are some great moments but I
think it sort of steps on the toes of the bisexual short story collection.
ALISTAIR
Great. Just wanted your invaluable
opinion.
HANNAH Awesome, yeah.
(pause)
I just recently learned that invaluable means very valuable.
(pause)
As opposed to not-at-all-valuable.
(pause)
So I was hoping to speak to you about something...
He is updating his Facebook status: “Monday Bloody Monday.”
Shoot.
ALISTAIR
HANNAH
Well I’ve been here since... well,
over a year, now.
ALISTAIR
Has it really been that long?
HANNAH (nodding)
But my circumstances have recently changed and I can no longer... afford to work for free.
ALISTAIR
Free? Well, we like to think we’re
paying you in experience.
HANNAH (surprised)
Of course, yeah. And this has been, like, so unbelievably educational. But... I know Shannon mentioned that she got hired after interning, and I guess I wondered--
ALISTAIR (chuckling)
Oh, Hannah. Shannon’s been with us since 2006. But in this economy?
(MORE)
16.

Pause
(pause)
So if you feel like you have nothing left to gain from us...
HANNAH
It’s not that, really. It’s just...
I have to eat.
ALISTAIR
When you’re hungry enough, you
figure it out.
HANNAH
Do you mean physically hungry or,
like, hungry for the job?
ALISTAIR (cheerful)
Well, Hannah. We’ll really miss your energy. I wish you the luck of the Irish in all your future endeavors.
She’s shocked.
Pause
ALISTAIR (CONT’D) Please take any books you might
want. Just so long as you stick to soft covers.
HANNAH
You mentioned that I could send you
my book... Once I’d polished it up. Is that still alright?
ALISTAIR
Well we won’t have you to read it
for us, will we?
ALISTAIR (CONT'D)
Do you know how many internship
requests I get every day?
HANNAH
I assume a lot, but--
ALISTAIR Fifty. About fifty. I route them to my spam
practically folder.
17.

INT. SHOSHANNA AND JESSA’S APARTMENT, EARLY EVENING
JESSA lies across the single bed, looking at a worn Polaroid--
Hannah (in shorts) Marnie and Jessa on bicycles in front of an ivy-covered building that says “East Hall.” Jessa impishly points at a giant bong sticking out of her bike basket. Marnie laughs. Hannah looks very serious while surreptitiously flashing one tit.
SHOSHANNA
You gonna’ start unpacking? You
must have all kinds of adorable French shit. And where were you before that?
JESSA
Before France? Um, Amsterdam?
(pause)
No, I was in Bali for a little while. Learning to weave. And then I met this surfer.
SHOSHANNA Girlfriend had a blue crush!
Jessa looks queasy, rubs her stomach.
SHOSHANNA (CONT’D) Jetlag? Major jetlag?
JESSA I’m just nauseous.
SHOSHANNA
Do you need something?
JESSA
Maybe... Do you have a Xanax?
SHOSHANNA (shaking her head)
Sorry, no.
JESSA
I’d take a Klonopin also. Or a
Flexerill--
SHOSHANNA I have, like, pepto.
INT. HANNAH AND MARNIE’S APARTMENT, EVENING
MARNIE is making dinner, with CHARLIE as her prep cook.
18.

MARNIE
I really thought it was some
complex firing hoax.
CHARLIE
(hanging on every word)
So what did you do when you realized it was real?
MARNIE
I went into the bathroom and puked.
CHARLIE
That’s my girl. Pukey Roth.
MARNIE
I hate it when you call me that.
CHARLIE
You do? I thought you said it made
you feel “known.”
The door opens and HANNAH walks in, bedraggled and bummed, carrying a plastic bag of paperbacks.
HANNAH Hello party people.
CHARLIE Hannah! Did you hear?
HANNAH Hear what?
CHARLIE (to Marnie)
Did you tell her?
MARNIE
I didn’t tell her yet--
CHARLIE
You are looking at a real live
account executive. HANNAH
You got promoted? Marnie nods.
HANNAH (CONT’D) (in disbelief)
The dove thing?
19.

MARNIE
Last week this publicist had a
breakdown and enrolled in pastry school, and then they saw how I handled this reporter and the headline was really positive, so...
CHARLIE
Tell her what the headline was!
MARNIE (vaguely guilty)
“Dove Situation Not So One-Sided After All.”
HANNAH
That’s so amazing, Marnie. That’s,
like, the best thing ever to happen to... not me.
Hannah looks stricken.
MARNIE Are you OK?
HANNAH
Yeah, I’m totally fine, I’m just...
Things didn’t really work out that well at work.
MARNIE Oh, Hannah.
HANNAH
No, don’t worry, it’s really--
Marnie hugs her.
MARNIE
You’re going to be fine. We will
find you a better job, one that’s worthy of your--
CHARLIE Wait, what’s going on?
MARNIE
(a little annoyed)
Hannah’s parents cut her off.
HANNAH
They didn’t cut me off.
(pause)
They’re going to cut me off.
20.

CHARLIE (weirdly hopeful)
Does that mean you have to move out?
Marnie glares at him.
HANNAH
I’m just going to take a walk, OK?
MARNIE
What? Why? Jessa will be here in
like half an hour. (forced cheer)
Da’ girls. Together again.
HANNAH
It’s very sweet of you to act
excited. I just need to, like, breathe. Assess my creative goals. Break in my new clogs.
(pause)
Because they’re probably the last shoes I will ever own.
Hannah heads for the door.
HANNAH (CONT’D)
I love you, you corporate queen.
Marnie smiles.
HANNAH (CONT’D)
When I look at you, a Coldplay song
plays in my heart. See you soon.
Hannah descends the stairs of the building. As soon as she’s out of Marnie’s sight, her faces crumples. She’s terrified.
INT. SHOSHANNA AND JESSA’S APARTMENT, NIGHT JESSA is in the bathroom retching.
SHOSHANNA Jessa? Babe?
JESSA Mmm hmm.
SHOSHANNA
You throwing up, babe? You
ralphing?
21.

Pause.
JESSA (feeble)
Kind of.
SHOSHANNA On purpose?
(mouthed to herself) I knew it.
(pause)
This is something Aunt Ilene struggled with for years. That’s why her hair is so patchy. And she said it’s not about weight. It’s about control.
Jessa opens the door a crack.
JESSA It’s not that.
SHOSHANNA (backing away)
Are you sick?
JESSA Sort of--
SHOSHANNA
Because I really can’t afford to
get sick right now. I’m supposed to go to 1Oak tonight. A table. With bottle service. Last time I had a stomach flu my whole
(motions to her bowels) Situation was fucked for a month.
JESSA (feeble)
I don’t think I’m contagious.
SHOSHANNA
Maybe it’s food poisoning?
JESSA Maybe.
SHOSHANNA OK, Good.
(pause)
And I’m very glad you’re not
bulimic.
(MORE)
22.

SHOSHANNA (CONT'D)
If I learned anything from being in
a sorority it’s that reverse peristalsis is no joke.
EXT. FORT GREENE BROOKLYN, NIGHT
HANNAH emerges from the subway and pulls out her iphone. Dials. Moves nervously from foot to foot.
HANNAH (fake casual)
Yo. Hey. Yeah, I’m actually just leaving a friend’s house that’s, like, by your house...
She keeps walking until she reaches a pre-war apartment building. Stops.
HANNAH (CONT’D)
Totally weird, yeah. So I’m right
here, if you’re not... Oh, cool. I’ll be there in, like--
She rings the buzzer.
INT. ADAM’S APARTMENT, NIGHT
A messy living room full of half-finished woodwork. ADAM opens the door for HANNAH. Adam-- 33, handsome in a slightly off way. He wears cool worn jeans, no shirt. A heady mix of sleazy and in-on-the-joke. Nice body.
ADAM Doll.
HANNAH (smiling)
Doll. That’s what my dad calls me.
ADAM (impish)
Yeah, he told me. We’re in the same reading group.
(pause)
You were nearby?
HANNAH
Yeah, at my friend... Katie’s.
Katie from camp. She’s... a speech writer for the mayor. Lives right around the corner.
23.

ADAM Where?
HANNAH
(dug herself a hole)
It’s weird-- I had a few drinks so I’m actually not sure. I’m, like, really beat.
(pause)
I had a pretty shitty day.
She flops down on the couch.
ADAM Oh yeah?
HANNAH
I kind of lost my job. At the
press.
ADAM
Weren’t you an intern?
HANNAH (embarrassed)
I mean, sort of but--
ADAM
So they basically just asked you
not to hang out there anymore.
HANNAH
I’m trying not to freak out. I was
an English major, so I feel like there must be some use for my skill set, but I need to, like...
ADAM
I was comp lit. Haven’t done much
with it.
Hannah looks around the room at the half-finished shelves, tables. Messy tools. A pile of nails.
HANNAH
But it’s really cool what you do.
Being a carpenter is really, like, honest work.
(pause)
It’s nice to see you. I loved the book you gave me.
24.

ADAM
What book? Oh, yeah, the Lowell.
You said you liked stuff by authors who wrote from the madhouse.
HANNAH (smiling)
I do. And it was very sweet of you to remember my birthday.
ADAM
(he’d had no idea, and
he’s not trying to hide
it)
Of course, your birthday.
She laughs, looks at him for a long moment then kisses him ferociously.
ADAM (CONT’D) (amused by her fervor)
Yo.
You know that part in Monster’s Ball where Halle Berry is like “fuck me til’ I forget.”
ADAM Haven’t seen it.
HANNAH
Me neither. It’s in the trailer.
ADAM
They say fuck in the trailer?
HANNAH
The way you touch me makes me feel
like someone else.
Hannah kisses him more, pulling at his belt.
HANNAH (CONT’D)
You know that part on your resume
where they ask you to list your special skills?
ADAM
I haven’t applied for a job in a
long fuckin’ time, kid.
HANNAH (in his ear)
25.

HANNAH
I have no special skills.
Suddenly she doesn’t feel sexy. Just panicked. She sits back on the couch.
HANNAH (CONT’D) I type pretty fast.
(pause) I can read.
(thinking) I have legs.
Her anxiety is palpable. She stops kissing him, folds her arms. They’re quiet a moment.
ADAM
I might be able to hire you for
something. But we have to see if you fulfill all the requirements.
HANNAH What are--
ADAM
Lie on your stomach.
HANNAH I don’t...
He gives her the deep-eye stare. She does what he says.
ADAM
(whispering into her ear)
Don’t come over here and act like you make the rules.
HANNAH Excuse me?
ADAM
You modern career women.
(pause)
I know what you like.
HANNAH (genuinely curious)
What do we like?
She is fully face down. He is straddling her back.
ADAM
You like to be reminded who’s the
boss.
(MORE)
26.

ADAM (CONT'D) (pause)
Grab your legs.
HANNAH
What?
He hands her own feet to her. She’s in an odd boat position.
ADAM (whispered)
You said you want to feel like someone else?
HANNAH (whispered)
Yes.
ADAM
But what if you’re just my little
slut? (pause)
What if that’s your special skill? (pause)
I’m going to get some lube--
HANNAH Do we need--
ADAM
And when I get back I want you in
this exact same position. But with no pants on. And no panties.
HANNAH
I really hate the word pantie--
(she thinks better of expressing this)
OK.
ADAM
Leave your shirt on.
HANNAH Get a condom?
ADAM (wicked)
I’ll consider it.
Hannah turns her face to the side. Smiles to herself like “I can’t believe this is happening.” Flips over, starts to unzip her pants.
27.

EXT. NOLITA STREET, NIGHT JESSA hails a cab.
JESSA (to driver)
Can you take me to Brooklyn? Greenpoint?
She gets into the back and falls across the seat. She feels awful.
DRIVER
You can’t lie down in my cab.
JESSA Really? Why not?
DRIVER
It’s not safe. Some idiot hits me,
your neck is breaking in a second.
JESSA
I’m sorry, I don’t feel well. I’m
just trying to get...
DRIVER (worked up)
Please don’t throw up in my car. I always get the party girls in my car, saying “sorry, sorry” but they don’t feel sorry. They’ve never worked a day in their--
JESSA
No, no. I’m not drunk. I’m just...
(a plea for mercy) I’m pregnant.
DRIVER (suddenly kind)
Pregnant? Congratulations! First baby for you?
JESSA (wincing)
Yes. The first.
DRIVER
I myself have six. Every one a
blessing. My wife is like you-- young and strong. I picked her from a catalogue, sent from my country.
28.

Wow.
JESSA
DRIVER
Because the babies that come from
the young woman, they drink less milk but still they grow faster.
(pause)
Your husband is lucky man. Nice neighborhood I pick you up from. You live in this neighborhood?
JESSA
I just moved here, yeah.
DRIVER
Another good neighborhood for
raising children? Dyker Heights. You know Dyker heights? Near Bay Ridge, Gravesend. Has it all. Three playgrounds and a butcher.
INT. ADAM’S APARTMENT, NIGHT
HANNAH and ADAM are done having sex. They sit on the couch together, naked, their scandalous parts covered by a beach towel. Hannah is curled up in a ball, cold.
Pause
ADAM
Sorry. All my sheets are at the
laundromat. (pause)
This is what you have to look forward to once you hit thirty.
HANNAH
Am I the youngest person you’ve
slept with? Like, the person who’s the most years younger than you?
ADAM (laughing)
Sadly, no. I’m trying not to date women under twenty-five, though. It’s pretty much my only moral position.
HANNAH I’m twenty four.
29.

Pause
ADAM
You’ve got a pretty unique
attitude, though. (pause)
And you don’t look like a little Filipino boy. That’s been my weakness in the past.
(pause)
But it’s hard-- women over thirty? It’s a whole other thing. And it’s not my thing.
HANNAH
Because of their biological clock?
ADAM
Well, that too. But I’m just
talking about their skin. It starts to hang differently. And it’s not about fat, or skinny. There’s just a looseness there.
HANNAH (terrified)
So my skin is basically the tightest it will ever be?
ADAM Afraid so.
He stands, heads to the kitchen. His bare ass is a wonder to behold. He starts to boil water.
Adam nods.
ADAM (CONT’D)
And girls your age expect a lot. I
mean, you don’t seem to have it, but most of them? They haven’t yet been worn down by the world, so they’re just full of demands.
HANNAH
Like, of their boyfriends?
HANNAH (CONT’D)
My roommate Marnie... She’s always
calling her boyfriend in the middle of the night, like “I have a stomach ache. Bring me some food which I’m not going to eat.”
(pause) (MORE)
30.

HANNAH (CONT’D)
You know those girls? With the tiny business suits and the tiny stomach
aches? People love those girls.
ADAM
You want some tea?
HANNAH What kind?
ADAM
I make this brew out of opium pods.
(pause)
It’s just a pretty mellow high.
HANNAH
Opium? I don’t know. Last time I
smoked weed I told Marnie her face was knitting together and she had a crown of eyeballs.
(pause)
What does it taste like?
ADAM
Kind of like twigs.
HANNAH Like twix?
(pause)
I have to go have dinner with my friends. Will it make me act weird?
ADAM
It’s pretty subtle. And legal. You
can buy the pods in the flower district.
HANNAH
OK. No work tomorrow, so...
He hands her a cup. She takes a sip, coughs.
ADAM What?
HANNAH
I thought you said twix.
ADAM
No. Twigs. As in small sticks.
She keeps sipping.
31.

Pause
HANNAH
The most awful part is that if I
can’t be in New York, I can’t finish my book.
ADAM Your book?
HANNAH
It’s a collection of essays. About
my experience. You know, finishing school, moving here. Just, like, bits of wit... Sort of like if Oscar Wilde fucked boys.
ADAM
That was kind of his main thing.
HANNAH
And my parents think they’re so
metropolitan, that they understand the big picture, just because they teach at a fucking state school. But that makes it even worse, because they know about cool things and still choose not to do them. And I don’t want their life.
ADAM
How Varsity Blues of you.
HANNAH (sheepish)
They’re cutting me off just to prove a point. And my skin is the tightest it will ever be and they haven’t even read my writing.
(doleful)
They don’t even know who I am.
ADAM
Have you ever tried to tell them?
A light goes off in Hannah’s brain.
INT. HANNAH AND MARNIE’S APARTMENT, NIGHT MARNIE and CHARLIE are cleaning the kitchen.
32.

MARNIE (livid)
I can’t believe Hannah.
CHARLIE
Are you worried? Should we call
someone?
MARNIE
Oh, I know exactly where she is.
CHARLIE
Well, at least you didn’t have to
entertain Jessa on your own.
MARNIE
Because all my friends are total
flakes. And I end up looking like this old shrew with a vagina made of sand, just because I want them to, like, keep the plans they make.
CHARLIE (comforting)
Your vagina isn’t made of sand. (pause)
I’m here, OK? Babe, I’m here.
MARNIE (smiling wanly)
OK.
CHARLIE
And I’m in it to win it.
Marnie flinches. The doorbell rings.
CHARLIE (CONT’D) Who’s that?
Marnie peers out the window. It’s JESSA, standing in the street alone in her bowler hat. She looks up.
JESSA Marnie?
MARNIE (to Charlie) Where’s the key?
He passes her a key on an orange ribbon. Marnie lowers it.
33.

MARNIE (CONT’D) (coolly)
Top lock.
INT. MIDTOWN HOTEL ROOM, NIGHT
TAD and LOREEN are in bed in their pajamas channel surfing.
Alias is on.
TAD
Oh, this is fantastic.
(settling in)
A strong father/daughter bond is the core of this show.
Jennifer Garner kicks across the screen in black leather.
LOREEN
I’m sure that’s why you tune in.
TAD (tickling her)
You saucy bitch.
She giggles. A knock at the door.
LOREEN (loudly)
We already got the bed turned down! Gracias muchas!
Mom? Papa?
HANNAH (O.S.)
LOREEN Hannah?
TAD
I think that might be Hannah.
Loreen jumps up and gets the door. Hannah stands there, clutching a sheaf of paper. She is subtly high.
TAD (CONT’D)
Doll! What the heck are you doing
here?
HANNAH
I was just in the neighborhood.
(pause)
Mom. Papa. I’ve come to plead my
case.
(MORE)
34.

HANNAH (CONT'D) (pause)
I need to be in New York. If I’m going to have a chance.
LOREEN A chance at what?
HANNAH
To live, to have experiences that
fuel my work. To go full speed on my book. If you cut me off... I have nothing.
TAD
Let’s not use words like cut off,
OK?
LOREEN
Or “nothing.” This isn’t a Dickens
novel. We’re not going to let you starve. But we’re not up for bankrolling you lifestyle, so if you need to be here you can find a paying job--
HANNAH
Let’s not jump to any conclusions
yet. Not before... (thrusting her pages
forward)
I have pages. From the book.
LOREEN
Great. We’ll read them on the
plane.
HANNAH
No, now. I need you to read them
now. Because... I feel like I’ve been hiding something from you.
(pause)
I don’t want to freak you out, but...
(pause)
I think I may be the voice of my generation.
(pause)
At least a voice. A strong voice.
Hannah sits down in a chair, removes her jacket. She is definitely on drugs.
35.

HANNAH (CONT’D)
Before you start, I’ll just say...
I feel like I’ve done you a disservice by not letting you read this earlier. I think it would have saved you a lot of anxiety to know the seriousness of my product.
TAD
We know you’re serious, and we--
HANNAH
And I also understand that for
parents, the great fear is your children surpassing you. It’s a hope but also a fear. And that makes reading my work... daunting.
LOREEN
Are you alright, Hannah? You seem a
little--
TAD Keyed up...
HANNAH
Just read. There’ll be plenty to
say... after.
They’re reading together. Tad chuckles.
HANNAH (CONT’D) (excited)
Which part are you at?
TAD
I’m at-- well, I don’t want to say
because your mother is probably a little behind me.
LOREEN
I think I’m ahead of you.
haven’t laughed yet.
TAD
It’s funny stuff, Loreen.
you’re a very funny gir-- He trails off.
TAD (CONT’D) (suddenly incensed)
Now that’s just...
I just Hannah,
36.

LOREEN (reading)
That line right there?
TAD (angry)
That’s absolutely-- you know I’m your biggest fan, Hannah, but this is just hostile.
(to his wife) It’s an acting out.
HANNAH (scared)
What is?
TAD (reading)
‘It’s not my money’ I told Marnie as we charged the champagne on the card my father had provided “for emergencies only. I was pretty sure my unanswered text message was a kind of emergency. And anyway--
LOREEN (offended reading)
I could always deny the charges.
HANNAH
I forgot that was in there...
(regrouping)
That’s so clearly a joke.
LOREEN
If it was so clearly a joke you’d
be writing fiction. It’s hostile.
TAD Flippant and hostile.
HANNAH
But it’s, like, appreciative. Of
what you... Having you as my parents... It’s such a gift. Your love and support has made it possible for--
TAD
Oh don’t piss on my face and tell
me it’s raining. And to think, I was just telling your mother we should give you another few months. To figure it out.
(MORE)
37.

TAD (CONT'D)
Don’t cut the cord just yet, I
said. But now I feel like a real... nutsack.
LOREEN
A fool. He feels like a fool.
Hannah is slumping.
TAD
Can you hear that, girlfriend?
Hannah slumps further.
LOREEN
We’re not WaMu, Hannah. And the
least you could do is sit up straight and focus on--
Hannah slumps to the floor. Loreen goes to her.
LOREEN (CONT’D) Hannah? Oh, Jesus. Hannah?
HANNAH (muttering)
I shouldn’t have taken it, but it was just...
LOREEN Taken it?
TAD
What did you take?
LOREEN
Is she sick, Tad? Should we call
the hospital?
Tad examines his daughter, who is flopping like a fish.
TAD
I’m pretty sure she’s high. That
she smoked some strong herb.
LOREEN
Learn your own body, Hannah. Even I
know-- you have trouble obeying your hunger signals and you don’t do well with substances.
(to Tad)
Do you remember when she smoked a clove cigarette and we had to put the ice pack on her head?
38.

TAD
Hannah, I won’t get mad, alright?
I’m really just curious. What did you smoke? Was it just some g- shock. Purps?
Loreen looks at him quizzically.
TAD (CONT’D) (to his wife)
The various weeds have names. (to Hannah)
Level with me. I once told my mother someone had dropped Advil in my coke but I was actually on LSD.
HANNAH
It’s legal. Like flowers.
LOREEN
You’re too neurotic for
psychedelics. I’ve been saying that since you were a little girl.
HANNAH
Opium pods. A tea of opium pods.
TAD Opium pods?
LOREEN
We should Google that.
TAD
I don’t need to Google that. I know
about that. Tantamount to smoking banana peels. For chrissakes, let’s just order her a coffee.
HANNAH (faintly)
Coffee’s for grownups.
TAD
You’re drinking a strong coffee.
HANNAH (reanimated)
I am twenty four years old. Don’t tell me what to do!
LOREEN
Well, this is a real display.
39.

HANNAH (feverish)
Why is this happening? You’re both acting like crazy people... You can’t do it like this, you have to wean me off the teat, I...
(deep sigh)
Don’t be like doves. Don’t be doves and kill your baby.
INT. MARNIE’S BEDROOM, NIGHT
Tiny room, more maturely decorated than JESSA sit on the bed. Awkward distance.
JESSA
I’m sorry I was late.
MARNIE
I was expecting it.
JESSA (hurt)
It’s a little bit hard to get I wasn’t feeling very well. I throwing up.
MARNIE
I puked today too.
like
Hannah’s. MARNIE and
(pause)
I puke a lot. My
stress plague on
JESSA I’m pregnant.
(pause)
I’m late because
Shocked pause
MARNIE On purpose?
mom says it’s a women in their--
I’m pregnant.
Jessa looks scared, shakes her head. Marnie is suddenly wracked with guilt.
MARNIE (CONT’D) (smiling gently)
Look. You’re here, OK? You totally made it.
Marnie hugs her friend tightly.
here. was
40.

INT. HOTEL ROOM, MORNING
HANNAH awakes, groggy. Looks around. Her parents are gone. She picks up the bedside phone.
HANNAH
Hi. Um... I’m in room 407 and I’d
like to get some room service. (pause)
They’ve checked out already? So that means the account is closed? Like, I can’t add anything?
(pause)
Um, OK. No thanks. Thank you.
She walks to the desk where her coat is folded beside with her book pages. There are two envelopes. One says HOUSEKEEPING, the other HANNAH. She looks in hers. A twenty dollar bill. Looks in Housekeeping’s. Same. She adds the Housekeeping twenty to her own envelope.
EXT. MIDTOWN HOTEL, DAY
HANNAH exits, still groggy, sour looking. She doesn’t know where to head next. A HOMELESS MAN surprises her by speaking.
HOMELESS MAN
Why don’t you smile? Does your
heart hurt? Hannah smiles weakly.
HOMELESS MAN (CONT’D) Oh, girl. When I look at you, I
just wanna’ say ‘Hello, New York!’
Hannah holds her coat closed against the cold and walks. THE END
