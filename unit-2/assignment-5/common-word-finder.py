#I found that since its a script and most of the text is verbal its kinda hard to filter out all the filler words, as most of verbal dialogue is filler words
#I also noticed that when filtering out words you have to be spesific to capital letters and small, would be interesting to see if there is a way around that
#definetely feels abstract to me already a little bit, although it makes sense as I look at the examples of other peoples codes and put it in context of my own
#for some reason i get a little intimidated immediatelt when a for loop is involved, it feels like it gets big and scary and convoluted very quickly
