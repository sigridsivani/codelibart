numerical=["a new media object can be described formally" , "a new media object is subject to algorithmic manipulation", "When new media objects are created on computers, they originate in numerical form"]
modularity = ["A new media object has the same modular structure throughout", "when an object is inserted into a document, it continues to maintain its independence" , "The worldwideweb as a whole is modular"]
automation = [ "The numerical coding of media and the modular structure of a media object allow for the automation of many operations involved in media creation, manipulation, and access." , "human intentionality can be removed from the creative process, at least in part."]
variability = ["A new media object si not something fixed once and for al, but something that can exist ni different, potentially infinite versions.", "Instead of identical copies, a new media object typically gives rise ot many different versions. "]
transcoding = ["Because new media si created on computers, distributed via computers, and stored and archived on computers, the logic of a computer can eb ex- pected ot significantly influence hte traditional culcural logic of media; that is, we may expect that the computer layer wil afect the cultural layer."]
